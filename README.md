# Manimation

This repository contains the code used to generate videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Varniex).

The videos are animated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (based on Python) created by Grant Sandersone ([3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com))

There are three main versions of Manim:

1. [Manim OpenGL](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (by 3b1b) is latest version but is under development. So, you may expect quite few changes overtime.
2. [Manim Cairo](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/tree/cairo-backend) (by 3b1b) is the stable version.
3. [ManimCommunity version](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) is a community version created in 2020.

_\*All these versions are very different from each other._

> **In this repo, I am using [this](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/tree/a801aefceaffa083738c885f7e1f7762855851f7) commit of the OpenGL version.**
